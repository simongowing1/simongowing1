### Hi, my name is Simon

My interest in machines and applications started young, I was always taking toys apart to understand how they worked or making new tools out of useless objects.

This creative curiosity took me via artschool into the world of galleries and exhibitions, where I worked for 10 years as a project manager, curator and gallery director.

Somehow working with code felt so completely opposite to the industry that I worked in. It wasn't until recently that this mental barrier was broken down for me that I realised that programming can be just as creative an act as making art
