### Hello, I am Simon 🤝

My interest in machines and systems started young. I was always taking toys apart to understand how they worked or inventing new tools out of useless objects.
My father and I built my first computer together when I was 14 – a labour of love that *just* worked. But the journey was half the acheivement.

This creative curiosity and love for making took me, via artschool, into the world of galleries and exhibitions, where I worked for 10 years as a project manager, curator and gallery director.

Somehow, for so long working with code felt completely opposite to the path that I had taken – the work of the 'other' side of the brain. And it wasn't until I broke down this mental barrier that I saw programming to be the creative act that it is. And also a space to create beautiful things.

Once I realised this, I knew that I wanted to apply the same strategy for problems in the tech world – to find creative solutions to innovative projects.
