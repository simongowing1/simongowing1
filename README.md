## Always being creative

My interest in machines and systems started young. I was always taking toys apart to understand how they worked 🧰 or inventing new tools out of useless objects.🛠

This creative curiosity and love for making took me, via artschool 🎨, into the world of international galleries and exhibitions, where I worked for 10 years as a project manager, curator and gallery director. 🖼

Somehow, for so long, working with code felt completely opposite to the path that I had taken 👾 – the work of the 'other' side of the brain 🧠.  And it wasn't until I broke down this mental barrier that I saw programming to be the creative act that it is. And also a space to create beautiful things. 🍎

Once I realised this, I knew that I wanted to apply the same strategy to problems in the tech world – break down barriers and find creative solutions to innovative humane projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently building a bug tracking app collaborating with other alumni, using the MERN, React Hooks and scalable server-side filtering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to write tests with Jest.
- 👾 I'm currently having fun solving code challenges every morning with the [Kater Klub](https://github.com/simongowing1/Katas "Kater Klub repo") that I started.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creative projects to improve the relationship between users and technology.
